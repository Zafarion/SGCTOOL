NES Shadowgate text dumper/Inserter (Romhacking tool)
A tool I've coded in java about 15 years ago using Netbeans and Swing library to translate this game to brazilian portuguese. Is able to extract and reinsert all text dialogues and item names/descriptions.
But unfortunately it has a bug I never solved. You can't change text lines like this in the script: 'The (object) is open', 'The (object) is closed' or it ruins the game, unless the amount of digits before the (object) stays the same ('The ' = 4 digits).
